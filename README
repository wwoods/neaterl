-BASIC USAGE-
Create a file with a .erln extension, such as test.erln.

Copy the following into it:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-module(test)
-export([ hello_world/0, fac/1 ])

hello_world() -> io:format("Hello, World!~n", [])

fac(0) -> 1
fac(N) when is_integer(N) andalso N > 0 ->
  N * fac(N - 1)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Then, open up an erlang prompt, run "neaterl:compile(test).",
and the files test.erl and test.beam will be created, allowing
normal usage of the test module.
